# Bun_HTML_Server

A simple demonstration of Bun's HTML server capabilities with React and Svelte components integration.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6e653192-72af-4565-ad0a-f7992e88cdde/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bun-html-server/deploys)

## üìã Overview

This project demonstrates Bun's ability to serve HTML files directly as a server using the command `bun index.html`. It explores the integration of both React and Svelte components within this simple server setup, along with state management using Preact's Signals.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed (v1.2.5+)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bun_HTML_Server.git
cd Bun_HTML_Server

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Development mode
bun dev

# Build for production
bun build

# Preview production build
bun preview
```

## üéØ Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Test Bun's HTML Server Feature**: Explore the simplicity of creating a server using just HTML files with `bun index.html` as described in the [Bun HTML documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/html).

2. **Component Integration**: Test the integration of both React (already supported) and Svelte (newly supported in Bun 1.2.5) components.

3. **Shared State Management**: Experiment with using Preact's Signals (specifically `@preact/signals-react`) as a shared state management solution that works in both React and Svelte components:
   - Use a single signal instance as the source of truth across different component frameworks
   - Demonstrate that `@preact/signals-react` can be imported and used effectively in Svelte components
   - Achieve real-time synchronization between React and Svelte components using the same signal

4. **Persistence**: Implement local storage to maintain state between page navigations and browser sessions.

## üìù Key Features

- **Multi-framework Integration**: Seamlessly integrates React and Svelte components in the same application
- **Shared State**: Uses Preact's Signals for state management across different component frameworks
- **Modern Styling**: Implements Tailwind CSS with plugins for forms, typography, and DaisyUI components
- **Optimized Build Process**: Configured for development and production builds
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Maintains state between page navigations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**: All-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit
- **[React 19](https://react.dev/)**: Library for building user interfaces
- **[Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/)**: Component framework with a new reactive primitive ($state)
- **[Preact Signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals)**: Fine-grained reactivity system
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)**: Component library for Tailwind CSS
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Typed JavaScript

## üîç Implementation Details

### State Management

The application uses Preact's Signals from the `@preact/signals-react` package to maintain state between React and Svelte components:

```typescript
// src/store.ts
import {signal} from "@preact/signals-react";

export const count = signal(Number(localStorage.getItem("count") || 0));
```

### Local Storage Persistence

The counter value is persisted in localStorage, allowing the state to be maintained between page navigations and browser refreshes:

```typescript
// Example from React component
onClick={() => {
  localStorage.setItem("count", `${count.value + 1}`);
  count.value = Number(localStorage.getItem("count") || 0);
}}
```

### Build Configuration

The project is configured for development and production builds using Bun's build API with plugins for Tailwind and Svelte:

```typescript
// build.ts
import bunPluginTailwind from "bun-plugin-tailwind"
import bunPluginSvelte from "bun-plugin-svelte"

Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ["src/index.html", "src/another-page.html"],
  outdir: "./dist",
  minify: true,
  splitting: true,
  sourcemap: "linked",
  // ...other options
  plugins: [bunPluginTailwind, bunPluginSvelte],
});
```
